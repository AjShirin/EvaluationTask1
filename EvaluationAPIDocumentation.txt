- At First a main class has been creted called "MainRunE" where inside it is a function where it is called "choicesFunction()"
which is the function for the menue where the user choses.

- Next a scanner has been created to take in the user input and then the while loop has been used to repeat.

- after that the SOLID prenciple has been done using the switch/case where it has 2 cases, The first is the 
"GetRequest" where it fetches the data from the API  "https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random", and creates a text
file to save the data in the api which is called "dogBreedAPI".

- in the second case , a class has been created which is called "Search" where inside it is a scanner where at first it takes
it takes in the number of times the user whats to input a word, and then based on that it will asks the user one by one  what word 
they want to search for then if the word is available in the file , the output will be "word is available"
and will display the api, and if the word is not availabe it will will  display that the word is not available.

- the final case is to exit the system.
